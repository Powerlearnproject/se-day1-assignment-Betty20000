# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing high quality software products using well defined practices,principles,procedures and tools.
Importance include enhancing digital transformation,efficiency and innovation in business,education,entertainment,health sector and other daily activites.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Birth of programming language
2. Introduction of structured programming
3. introduction of Object oriented programming




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Research and planning
2. Problem statement
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
   


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall requires well defined project implemetation while agile involves a flexible project implementation style.
2. Waterfall includes focusing on the define rules until completion while agile involves regular changes during implementation
3. Waterfall involves comleting on project goal before moving to the next while agile involves working on a goal to a satisfying stage and may be completed later after moving to other goals.
4. Agile involves client through the whole process while waterfall involves the client once the project is completely finished.
  


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Implementing the project design through writing appropriete code.
Quality Assuarance Engineer - Testing the project to make sure it adheres to the allowed and defined instructions,rules,policies and regulations.
Project Manager - Planning,researching and developing project requirements

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
   

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
