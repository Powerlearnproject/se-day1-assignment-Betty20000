Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developing high quality software products using well defined practices,principles,procedures and tools.
Importance include enhancing digital transformation,efficiency and innovation in business,education,entertainment,health sector and other daily activites.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Birth of programming language
2. Introduction of structured programming
3. introduction of Object oriented programming




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Research and planning
2. Problem statement
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
   


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall requires well defined project implemetation while agile involves a flexible project implementation style.
2. Waterfall includes focusing on the define rules until completion while agile involves regular changes during implementation
3. Waterfall involves comleting on project goal before moving to the next while agile involves working on a goal to a satisfying stage and may be completed later after moving to other goals.
4. Agile involves client through the whole process while waterfall involves the client once the project is completely finished.
  


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Implementing the project design through writing appropriete code.
Quality Assuarance Engineer - Testing the project to make sure it adheres to the allowed and defined instructions,rules,policies and regulations.
Project Manager - Planning,researching and developing project requirements

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- This are software envinments that allow developers to write and test codes.eg. VS code.
   
3. Version Control Systems (VCS)-This are software environments that allows developers to store their code and track changes as they commit as well as collaborate with other developers.
   

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Dynamic technologies
2. Debugging complex challenges
3. Tight or unrealistic Dealines
4. Burnout


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing ensures that individual components are error-free.

Integration Testing ensures that the systemâ€™s components work together as intended.

System Testing ensures that the entire system functions correctly and meets the overall requirements.

Acceptance Testing ensures that the software meets business needs and is ready for deployment, as validated by stakeholders or end-users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and crafting inputs/instructions for AI models, in such a way that they produce desired, accurate, and useful responses.
### importance
Improving Response Accuracy
Reducing Ambiguity and Misinterpretation
Improving the AI efficiency


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1. Vague - "Tell me about AI."
2. Clear,specific and detatailed Improved prompt- "Provide a detailed explanation of artificial intelligence, covering its history, major subfields, and current applications in healthcare and finance."
